## Problem Statement
In the rapidly evolving digital world, the average user faces a significant *challenge in accessing and interacting* with web3 technologies. This includes complexities in managing digital wallets, conducting interchain and intra-chain transactions, minting NFTs, and keeping track of their digital assets. Moreover, the lack of integration of these advanced technologies into everyday communication platforms creates a barrier for **mass adoption**. The need for a solution that enables seamless usage of web3 within a familiar application like WhatsApp is clear. We believe that bridging such functionalities to an application that is being used by 1.5 Billion people will be the biggest gateway to help audience step into the world of web3.

## DeClick
Hello, this is Team We3DeGames, We believe in a very easy, simple, and layman's life. So the projects we design are totally amateur about the complexities but mature about the use case. With this description of the team, we introduce you to our work DeClick.

## Inspiration
Envisioning a future empowered by web3 technologies is a shared dream within the digital ecosystem, but the intricacy of such technologies makes it challenging for the average user to navigate. The transformative potential of blockchain technology has piqued interest globally, leading developers to work tirelessly in a bid to translate complex applications into user-friendly platforms.
In this innovative pursuit, our team at Binary was struck by an inspiring concept: creating a plugin that could seamlessly integrate multiple communication channels with the varied elements of web3, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs. We've designed this plugin to function as a versatile webhook, readily compatible with diverse communication platforms such as WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram, and beyond. With this innovation, we aim to make the power of web3 accessible to everyone, everywhere.

## How is DeClick different!!!
We here at declick make it simple enough that non-techies can also connect to their communicative channels and utilize the services of minting and storing not only static NFTs but also dynamic NFTs. It incorporates features of a wallet to connect across chains and work with transfers of tokens.
USPs of DeClick
- The story of NFTs does not end with static NFTs but extends to storing, transferring, and minting **dynamic NFTs**.
- It provides a simple and accessible way of interacting with the Blockchain to a platform with 1.5 Billion users.
- The plugin provides more than a wallet which includes interchain token swap along with intrachain swap
- Provides notification when a transaction is made to your wallet 
    Eg: Tokens transferred to your wallet 

## Approach
The interaction to our build works through our APIs which make the integration with the other SDKs or the service providers of the features. The application works completely on polygon and uses SDK like Revise Network, Tatum, and Router Protocol. The user has to remember a password of his choice which the user has to enter every time to utilize the services. This password is used to encrypt the data which is indexed in the chain. He can opt for the service he requires with less than 5 messages which fulfill his requirement.

## Challenges we faced 
- Planning the data to be indexed and encrypting the data to store on the chain. 
- Integration of router for cross-chain swaps.
- Building a seamless flow for the users to perform functions.
- Integration services without compromising the functionality and efficiency.
- Addition of Dynamic NFTs as they require changing of their configuration every now and then.

## Future Builds
- Assistant integration to access all the functions which your voice commands 
- Transfer of NFTs cross chain without burn and mint process 
- Using zk-Proofs to make abstraction more secure

## Technologies used 
NodeJS,ExpressJS,Revise,Tatum,Polygon,Router,Twilio.
