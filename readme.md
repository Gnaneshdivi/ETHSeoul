It is a Whatsapp plugin that acts as a layer between the layman and the web3 universe. This plugin incorporates the functionalities of a wallet and the feature of minting Dynamic and static NFTs.As a wallet, it does Interchain and intra-chain Transactions. All these features are done with less than 5 messages and also creates notification when tokens are transacted into your wallet.

## ~Binary
Hello, this is Team ~Binary, We believe in a very easy, simple, and layman's life. So the projects we design are totally amateur about the complexities but mature about the use case. With this description of the team, we introduce you to our work DeClick.

## Inspiration
Web3 ecosystem as a whole visualizes to see a world running on web3 technologies but it is one of the composite technologies existing in this era. Everyone is interested in utilizing the strength given by blockchain. Developers have been working on this vigorously to transform complex applications into easily accessible platforms.
In this process of innovation, our team binary was hit by the idea of making it a plugin for multiple communication channels. We can up with a plugin to serve different components of web3 like cryptos and NFTs.This plugin can be integrated as a webhook to any of the communication channels like WhatsApp, discord, telegram, etc.

## How is DeClick different!!!
We hear at declick make it simple enough that non-techies can also connect to their communicative channels and utilize the services of minting and storing not only static NFTs but also dynamic NFTs.It incorporates features of a wallet to connect across chains and work with transfers of tokens.
USPs of DeClick
- The story of NFTs does not end with static NFTs but extends to storing, transferring, and minting dynamic NFTs.
- It provides a simple and accessible way of interacting with the Blockchain
- The plugin provides more than a wallet which includes interchain token swap along with intrachain swap
- Provides notification when a transaction is made to your wallet 
    Eg: Tokens transferred to your wallet 

## Approach
The interaction to our build works through our APIs which make the integration with the other SDKs or the service providers of the features. The application works completely on polygon and uses SDK like revise, Tatum, and router. The user can create or import a wallet by providing his private key to access the plugin. The user has to remember a password of his choice which the user has to enter every time to utilize the services. This password is used to encrypt the data which is indexed in the chain. He can opt for the service he requires with less than 5 messages which fulfill his requirement.

## Challenges we faced 
- Planning the data to be indexed and encrypting the data to store on the chain 
- Integration of router for cross-chain swaps
- Building a seamless flow for the users to perform functions.
- Integration services without compromising the functionality and efficiency

## Future Builds
- Assistant integration to access all the functions which your voice commands 
- Transfer of NFTs cross chain without burn and mint process 
## Technologies used 
NodeJS,ExpressJS,Revise,Tatum,Polygon,router.
